History of DW Drums:

DW Drums, officially known as Drum Workshop, Inc., is an American drum kit and drum hardware manufacturer founded in 1972 by Don Lombardi in Agoura Hills, California. The company started as a small workshop that built tailored drums and drum accessories, gradually growing its reputation for quality and craftsmanship. 

In 1984, the company introduced its first retail product, the DW Collector's Series drum set, which gained popularity among professional drummers. Over the years, DW Drums became known for its innovative approaches to drum design, such as the use of maple and birch shells, drum hardware quality, and custom finishes. 

Through its partnerships with renowned drummers like Neil Peart, Chad Smith, and others, DW has established itself as a favorite brand among musicians. The company also pioneered manufacturing techniques, such as the 'True-Pitch' tuning system and Edge Technology.

In addition to drums, DW also manufactures pedals, hardware, and percussion instruments. Their commitment to quality continues to make them a significant player in the drumming industry.
